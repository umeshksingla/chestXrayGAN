### Learning to generate Chest X-Ray Images from sample data


We use an existing implementation of deep convolutional GAN in [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html) to learn and generate chest X-Ray images directly. 
The dataset includes combined 5216 images of healthy people chest X-Rays and that of people with pneumonia.
Later we also calculate the Inception score and FID score of the generated images. 

Look into the report pdf. It was only meant as an end-to-end exercise and in no way is fine-tuned or claimed to be my own.
